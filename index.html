		<h1>My story</h1>
		<p>
			One night while dreaming I was visited by my spirit animal
			<br>
			turns out it is a White Skull covered in a Pink Flame (PFWS).
			<br>
			<br>
			It told me to become a Software Engineer to fight the monsters of Closed Source.
			<br>
			One day I will have to fight those monsters to build a freer society
			<br>
			where people will truly own the software they use.
			<br>
			<br>
			This is my mission and I will <b>DIE</b> for it. //jk
